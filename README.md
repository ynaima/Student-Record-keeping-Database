# Student-Record-keeping-Database
The student record-keeping database management system is a system that is mainly designed to store and maintain student information including but not limited to personal information, contact information and academic information such as student gpa and their program of study. The data in the database is stored in MySQL server 8.0. Dummy data was used during the implementation of the database. Data can be accessed through the terminal. This design is to allow easy data entry and access through querying. The main objective of the database design was to have an efficient, normalized database that would allow easy data entry and access. The entity relational diagram, the relational schema, the physical data with the data types used in the relations are also included in this document.
